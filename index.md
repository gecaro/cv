## Currently

Data Engineer @ [Holded](https://www.linkedin.com/company/holded/)

Since 2019 I work at Holded. Started as a QA Engineer intern while finishing my degree and then moved to the Data Team (which has always been what I wanted to do in the first place). Good thing about QA-ing is that I developed my inner scrum-master. 

As of now, I have been working for a year on the Data team as a Data Engineer. My tasks consist on the following:
* - Develop and mantain our ELT pipelines to populate our DW.
* - Working (a lot) with different APIs to create integrations on data destinations for reverse ETL.
* - Mantaining GTM on a Server-Side approach. 
* - Working closely with the Analytics and Growth teams to coordinate their Data needs. 

### My skills

* Advanced Python | I have been working with python for three years doing a wide variety of things, from scrappers to AI models. Currently I work with python for mantaining workers and Jupyter Notebooks. 

* Google Cloud Platform | Experience working with GCP. Mainly with BigQuery, Pub/Sub and Dataflow.

* Google Tag Manager |Â Good domain of the technology begind GTM. Specially their Server-Side Tagging version.

* Intermediate SQL | I work with SQL on my daily basis and I feel comfortable using it. 


### Interests

I am looking for challenges. Data Engineering is something that is constantly changing and the stacks behind it are turning more powerful year after year, this is one of the reasons why I love this job so much. That being said, I am looking for a place to master my skills and become a proficient engineer.
